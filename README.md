# onlinePasswordGenerator

I have created an online password generator without any buttons. 
It generates a 14-character password, 
including uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, and other symbols (digits, *, etc.). 
It is developed using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. 
The password is generated directly on the webpage, 
so you can refresh the page to get a new password. 
However, if you don't mind which password it generates, 
you can take the first one displayed when you visit the page.
